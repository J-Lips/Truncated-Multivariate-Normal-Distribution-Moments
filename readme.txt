This package allows the calculation of the first and second moment of doubly truncated multivariate normal distributions analytically.
It is an implementation of B.G. Manjunath and S. Wilhelm, "Moments Calculation for the Doubly Truncated Multivariate Normal Density", Journal of Behavioral Data Science, 2021. (DOI: https://doi.org/10.35566/jbds/v1n1/p2)
The authors of this paper created the R package tmvtnorm (https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/tmvtnorm/index.html).
The R package contains a random number generator for the truncated multivariate normal and Student t distribution, as well as the calculation of probabilities, quantiles, and (marginal) densities. 
Their R code was used as basis for this matlab implementation.
