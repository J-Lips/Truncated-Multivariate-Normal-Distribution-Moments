This package allows the analytical calculation of the first and second moment of doubly truncated multivariate normal distributions in matlab.
It is an implementation of B.G. Manjunath and S. Wilhelm, "Moments Calculation for the Doubly Truncated Multivariate Normal Density", Journal of Behavioral Data Science, 2021. (DOI: https://doi.org/10.35566/jbds/v1n1/p2)
The authors of the paper created the R package tmvtnorm (https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/tmvtnorm/index.html).
This R code was used as basis for the matlab implementation.
The matlab code falls under GPL 3.0 license.

The function mvrandn.m is an exception to this.
